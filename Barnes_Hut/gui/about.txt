Barnes-Hut Simulation version beta 1.1

This GUI behaves as a config file editor and a frame visualiser.
For real time simulations, please run "RunSimulation.py". The simulator uses the most recent save of the config file, which is created by clicking run to open my annoying dialog box.

For full understanding of the behaviour, and explanation of some of the variable types, please read the report.

For the advanced config there are a few clarifications not yet implemented:
    - Size of Galaxy is the number of stars in the Galaxy
    - Buffer Sizes are the maximum sizes of the data queues
    - Fixed Size in the Quad Tree refers to scaling of the tree around the space with stars, or all space. It doesn't make much of a performance difference but it's all about the aesthetic sometimes.

This program still has quite a few unfinished features:
    - needs condition control on user input
    - gravity config is rudimentary
    - Tkinter denied embedding real-time simulator

as well as fully fledged doc-strings. Unfortunately I did not have time for these within the 3 weeks assessment period, but have every intention of including them later on (bar the doc-strings).

If you want to understand the code better, the report is a good place to start.
