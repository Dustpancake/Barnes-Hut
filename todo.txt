TODO

end time stuff, cus processes aren't terminating correctly
    i.e. when worker process is idle, data stream to logic halts
        -check if queue is empty or something

GUI stream needs better way to get tree:
    at the moment it's just scanning all the way through, maybe
    preceed the tree items with a length so the GUI knows what it is
    expecting

DONE::need COM
display options as listed in the config

DONE::
workers are still considering their own stars when working out forces

velocity generation

all of control interface

terminate processes correctly
